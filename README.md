📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes user sentiment in social media posts to determine whether the opinions expressed are positive, negative, or neutral. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the project helps understand public perception, track sentiment trends, and provide insights for brand management and decision-making.

🚀 Features

Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).

Sentiment classification using machine learning models.

Visualization of sentiment distribution and trends.

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation and preprocessing

NLTK / SpaCy – Natural language processing

Scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Development environment
